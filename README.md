# generator-node-env [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
>  a Simple Generator to create a standardised node environment using newer ES standards.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-node-env using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-node-env
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo node-env
```

## Getting To Know Yeoman

 * Yeoman has a heart of gold.
 * Yeoman is a person with feelings and opinions, but is very easy to work with.
 * Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
 * Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

## Node Env

Node Env is a very simple node environment that comes preloaded with some common
settings which (in my experience) a lot of node projects need, including Babel,
Linting and Testing. Explore the package.json to see what commands it comes with.

This will also allow you to use modern ES6/7 features such as async, object.assign and more.
